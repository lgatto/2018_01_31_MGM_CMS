** An early career researcher's view on modern and open scholarship

*** Intro

I have an agenda here. My goal is to lure you away from the dark
side. The dark side is comfortable, that's were the powers in place
rule, where the masses follow the senior leadership. It is a
/reasonable/ option to choose. But I want to make you think about
joining the rebel alliance.

*** Qst

- What is open scholarship, open research, open science...?
- What is your experience with openness?
- Open (or lack thereof) driven by supervisor?
